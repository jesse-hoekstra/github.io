This paper analyzes how mediated calendar effects on stock returns are moderated by firm size. We develop moderated mediation models, new to financial econometrics, employing fixed effects and EGARCH models, for S&P500 and tech companies. Firm size significantly changes relations in the causal graph, establishing moderation by firm size. For tech companies, our findings challenge traditional views that the January effect primarily applies to small-cap firms. The calendar effect is also pronounced in large-cap tech firms. For the S&P500, only the mediated September effect is significantly moderated by firm size in stage one and two, but not the direct effect.
