We consider instead the data dependent critical value function conditioning on the second-smallest
eigenvalue, as this eigenvalue is the appropriate indicator for weak identification.
We find that the data dependent critical value function of GKM also applies to this
conditioning and show that this test has correct size and power strictly higher than
the GKM test when the number of parameters not under test is larger than one.
